In the project directory, you can run this script after cloning:

### `npm install`
Do this first to install all component that this project need.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `Deploying to android`
Before you deploy it, change the code in capacitor.config.json file, at the last line "linuxAndroidStudioPath" : "/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh" into your android studio path. If youre using windows change into 
"windowsAndroidStudioPath" : "Your_Path"
If you want to deploy this project into apk installer (android), do this :

### `npx cap add android`
To build android dependencies

### `npx cap copy android`
If code has changed, use this script to make your changing come to android


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
